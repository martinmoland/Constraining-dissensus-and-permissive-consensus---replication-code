# Constraining-dissensus-and-permissive-consensus---replication-code
Replication code and data for "Constraining dissensus and permissive consensus - Variations in support for core state power integration". The paper investigates whether EU publics are more likely to support integration of core state powers than regulatory powers. I show that this is not the case. 

Before running the replication code please run

```
install.packages("fixest")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("naniar")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
