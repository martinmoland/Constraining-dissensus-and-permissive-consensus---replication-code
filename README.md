# Constraining-dissensus-and-permissive-consensus---replication-code
Replication code and data for "Constraining dissensus and permissive consensus - Variations in support for core state power integration". The paper investigates whether EU publics are more likely to support integration of core state powers than regulatory powers. I show that this is not the case. 

The code relies on having a working install of the packages "fixest", "dplyr", "naniar" and "ggplot2".
